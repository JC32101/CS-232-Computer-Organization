The failed inputs from miidpoint_A are [-2147483] and [2147483646] and the failed inputs of midpoint_B are [-3] and [-23]. In midpoint_A, an overflow will occur when the inputs consist of negative and positive big integers. As midpoint_B, it doesn't work with integers of negative integers. However, in midpoint_C, any type of integer provided will result with the correct midpoint.

In midpoint_A, there was an overflow when it computed [y-x]. During midpoint_C, it will convert the [x & y] and [(x ^ y) >> 1] then add these two together for the correct midpoint. In this process, [2147483646 & (-2147483) = 0b0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 & 0b1101 1111 0011 1011 0110 0101 = 0b0111 1111 1101 1111 0011 1011 0110 0100] and [(2147483646 ^ -2147483) >> 1 = (0b0b0111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 1110 ^ 0b1101 1111 0011 1011 0110 0101) >> 1 = 0b1000 0000 0010 0000 1100 0100 1001 1011 >> 1 = 0b1100 0000 0001 0000 0110 0010 0100 1101]. When [0b0111 1111 1101 1111 0011 1011 0110 0100 + 0b1100 0000 0001 0000 0110 0010 0100 1101], we get the correct midpoint of [0b0011 1111 1110 1111 1001 1101 1011 0001] = [1072668081].

In midpoint_B, an overflow will occur when it computes [(unsigned int)x + (unsigned int)y)] and it results the answer to be positive each time because when shift happens, a 0 will be added since the integer is unsigned. However, in midpoint_C none of the problem occured. In midpoint_C, it will convert the [x & y] and [(x ^ y) >> 1] then add these two together for the correct midpoint. In this process, [(-3) & (-23) = 0b1111 1101 & 0b1110 1001 = 0b1110 1001] and [(-3 ^ -23) >> 1 = (0b1111 1101 ^ 0b1110 1001) >> 1 = 0b0001 0100 >> 1 = 0b0000 1010]. When [0b1110 1001 + 0b0000 1010], we get the correct midpoint of [-13] = [0b1111 0011].
