Accodring to the stack frame shown in the picture, the address of each increase in start seems to be increasing by 0x40 in hex values (64 in decimal) which is 64 in bytes. At start = 5, the address of start is &0x7ffdc088a4dc and at start = 6, the address is &0x7ffdc088a49c. If we use these two start address and subtract them, then we get [&0x7ffdc088a4dc - &0x7ffdc088a49c = 140727833634012 - 140727833633948 = 64 = 0x40]. When we find the difference between each other addresses, the result would be the same as 0x140 or 64 in bytes. Thus, we can conclude that the stack frame size is 64 bytes of printSumRangeRecursive.
