Accodring to the stack frame shown in the picture, the address of each increase in start seems to be increasing by 4 bytes. At start = 5, the address of start is &0x7ffc8fc3238c and at start = 6, the address is &0x7ffc8fc3234c. The difderence between these two start is 4 bytes.
=======
Let us print out the address of start in different stack frames of printSumRangeRecursive. What do you think the stack frame size of printSumRangeRecursive is? Write down your speculation in a text file stack_frame_size_answer.
