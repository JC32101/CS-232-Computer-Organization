The sum at start = 582 is 0,which is also shown in gdb in the picture. According to the code of the method, the sum is stated as 0 instead of the actual sum from 0 tp 582 because in recursion, the sum is still ongoing and not yet returned.
=======
Now, the last part of the task is to use conditional breakpoints to find out when you run ./recursion 1000, what would the value of sum in printSumRangeRecursive be returned when start == 582? Write down your answer in Conditional_breakpoint_answer and take a screenshot of the gdb output based on which you derive your answer.
