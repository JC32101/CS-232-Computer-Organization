According to the screenshot, the sum of start at 582 is 330429. In gdb, I ran b 26 if start == 582 then r 1000, which is the line after the recursions. If I break at the moment before or at the recursions, there won't be any number assigned or added to the sum yet because is undergoing a recursion. After the debugger stops at the break point, I can call on p sum to know what the current value of sum at start = 582 is.
